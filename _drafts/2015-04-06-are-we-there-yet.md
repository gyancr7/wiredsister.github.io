Sometimes when I've had too much to drink I do a neat party trick where I tell people that "...I'll be in my prime during my mid-forties."

"Sex will be better, I won't care how big my thighs are, and I'll stop doing that stupid thing where I cut off all my hair with my husband's buzzers!"

The response is sixty-fourty amusement/pity, biased towards the pity of course. Eventually the gambit backfires and my audience starts reminiscing all the while doling out snapple-cap wisdom and stern warnings of "carpe diem." I find that people love to talk about their twenties the same way they love to talk about having survived the shingles, memories like: "You wouldn't believe the parties I crashed! The drugs I took!" Those were the days indeed.

The truth is I have no idea what I’ll be eating for breakfast tomorrow, let alone how conservative my haircut will be at 47. But I’m sure anything is better than being young; being a twenty-four year old in America today is daunting. For one thing, you are brutually aware of how mediocre your life actually is. You finaly realize that you went to school for something stupid like English and now you're walking dogs by day, moonlighting as a barrista, and using that meager income to buy a PBR for your okcupid date. Its as if every city is trying to be Portland, a city filled for the highly educated and highly unemployed. 

Now that I have a real job I don’t have much in common with friends from college or around the city. Reword this Here are the pharses of regular occurence.

A now a pause for a brief survey: 
1) Do you often find yourself 

"But what about your art?" I'm a sellout and sellouts don't go to Bushwick warehouse parties on Saturday. 
2) No, I can’t meet you for a margarita brunch on a Tuesday. 
3) No, I can’t quit my job and join your experimental theatre troupe and spend weekdays in Central Park dressed as a Captain Crunch. 
4) No, bloodsucking college alumni association, I will not give you a penny.
(One of those would do nicely as a replacement to my current voicemail. I can even make it bilingual: "Yo tengo trabajo. Dejam&eacute; en pas. Ciao.")

People who romanticize being a starving artist have never had to shuck 140 oysters a day.

I remember my first job in New York like it was yesterday.
