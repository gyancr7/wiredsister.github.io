A lot of people ask me what it's like to be a woman in tech. Here's a short list influcened by BuzzFeed and Kafka:
-- 

1. You have a 1 in 3 chance of finding the soap dispenser unopened in the girl's bathroom.

	_Yes, it's true. You really are the first female that's ever used the Ladies Room at that hackerspace. The cleaners they hired from Handy probably don't even bother to clean it anymore. TP dispenser only holds cobwebs? No one is going to mind if you wait in line for the men's room._

2. You get anxiety from looking at women's magazines.

	_You're at a cash register, buying some Mountain Dew and twinkies, when suddenly you notice People Magazine sitting innocuously on the rack beside you. Looking at the pink poncho draped elegantly over the female celeb, you glance down at your oversized hackathon t-shirt you got last Thursday at BattleHackCodingSkrillex for Women and Girls. "Who the hell is Kylie Jenner and why do I care about her nipple piercings?!" After all, the only People you know these days are Linus Torvalds or John Resig._

3. You've stopped going to women themed meetups.

	_You feel guilty about it, but secretly you've stopped going to "Girls Who Foo" or "Women in Baz" for a whole host of reasons. Maybe it's that they randomly charge $100 for a 10 minute demo on Ruby on Rails. Maybe it's because you feel all of the female coders came from a pricey 5 week boot camp or work in digital marketing/SEO/growthhacking. Maybe becase there aren't really any good coders there. All the good ones are too busy working, sleeping, or avoiding other humans._

4. You have fantasies of being Trinity from the Matrix.

	_It's okay. We get it. There's cosplay for things like that..._

5. You get called a Social Justice Warrior for pointing out something sexist.

	_Yes, it is really ridiculous that there aren't any female characters in GTA. Yes, there are female standup comics that are good. No, it's not uncommon for women to read comic books. Yes, women watch porn. Yes, I do know more about Star Trek TOS than you. No, using your SDK "isn't so easy your girlfriend could figure it out". No, I'm not your bro._
