Sometimes when I've had too much to drink, I do this neat party trick where I tell people I'll be in my prime during my mid-forties. "Sex will be better, I won't care how big my thighs are, and I'll stop doing that stupid thing where I cut off all my hair with my husband's buzzers!"

The response is sixty-fourty amusement, pity. Conversation eventually backfires and they start reminiscing, doling out snapple-cap wisdom and warning me sternly to "carpe that diem". People love to talk about their twenties the same way they love to talk about having survived the shingles. "You wouldn't believe the parties I crashed! The drugs I took!"

The truth is I have no idea what I’ll be eating for breakfast tomorrow, let alone how conservative my haircut will be at 47. But I’m sure anything is better than being young. Being a twenty-four year old in America today is daunting. You’re completely aware of how mediocre your life has become. You went to school for something stupid like English and now your walking dogs by day, a part-time barrista at night, using that meager income to buy a PBR for an okcupid date. Highly educated, highly unemployed. Now that I have a “real job” I don’t really have much in common with friends from college or around the city. "But what about your art?" I'm a sellout, and sellouts don't go to warehouse parties in Bushwick on Saturday. No, I can’t meet you for a margarita brunch on a Tuesday. No, I can’t quit my job and join your experimental theatre troupe and spend weekdays in Central Park dressed as a Captain Crunch. No, bloodsucking college alumni association, I will not give you penny.

Sure, I know what you're thinking internet. What a whiney, first-world-problem yuppie. Can't you just be happy? The answer is, no. I stopped being happy the day I realized that nothing is forever. Well, except student debt and minecraft.
