There's nothing more pathetic than a sore loser. 
==

I've never really thought about losing as a skillset, but it's what I've spent most of my life doing. It's probably what I'm best at. For example, I'm a mediocre chess player. This means that at around 4pm everyday I'm losing positioning midgame to a coworker. It means I fumble material, botch a knight at an inopportune moment, or don't see their attack on my queen 2 moves ahead. I'm bad at first person shooters. I'm clumsy with the buttons and get anxiety during the fight or flight. I prefer slower, more thoughtful puzzle games; sprawling maps to explore and worlds to conquer on my own time. I lose house keys and USB sticks, earrings and lipstick caps. I lose focus. I lose my temper. I've lost family members and lovers. I've lost religions, homes, jobs, and at the most painful moments of my life, I've lost dignity.

I remember sitting on the stairs to my apartment 3 years ago after yet another disappointing audition. I called my mother, sobbing that I should have never become an actor, that it was too hard. I was unhappy. I had no control over my life. I was 22 years old and my brain was rotting away waiting in line for my 5 minutes of fame. If I could talk to that Gina now, I'd tell her, "Chin up. Losing your dream feels like death, but it isn't death. This too shall pass, so pass the joint." 

A few months later someone would drop a $300 Lenovo in my lap and tell me to just fucking move on. And move on I did.

I built websites and read books. By day I was waiting tables and moonlighting as that shitty web designer who thought a DOM was some BDSM term. I read about bash scripting. I finally grokked Git. I learned what a pointer was. I even tried to understand what the hell a Monad was (hint: I didn't figure it out). I loved JavaScript, I hated JavaScript, then I realized it's just like that oppressive, cheap landlord that you gradually become okay with. I dreamt in error messages and logic gates. I had opinions on Emacs vs Vim (obviously Emacs) and read essays by Richard Stallman. I gave shitty presentations about Backbone.js at meetups. I helped you with that CSS thing. And all the while, the better I got the more of a failure I realized myself to be. I was terrible at programming, no better than some overblown jQuery-scriptkiddie. My comments were masturbatory and even today, looking at code three to four months old can cause blindness.

I've never been happier.

I say that not as an anecdote or be-all-end-all. I'm genuinely happy. I wake up everyday excited to work on problems bigger than myself. I'm excited to learn new things and make things that people want to use. I feel hopeful about the future.

One of the most disappointing things I've noticed in the tech community so far is the aversion for women to feel pain or failure. We're hyper-sensitive of their alienation (as if the way to make someone feel less odd is to talk about how odd they are constantly). They should feel rewarded for the accomplishement of being female and knowing what Linux is. Congrats! You're tech savvy and you have a vagina! You're a winner. 

Actually, no. You're still a loser.

As much as you win, you lose more. Anyone who's ever written code can tell you that. Coding is hard as fuck. 90% of your day is spent focusing on where you tried and didn't catch. These coding bootcamps and _Women Who Foo_ or _Girls That Baz_ seem to forget this. You can't spend 6 weeks coding and magically become a programmer. There are also mental and emotional changes that have to happen. You have to like puzzles. You have to like doing things yourself. You have to be okay with failure. Being a programmer is a state of mind.

I've been to a lot of hackathons. I've been to so many that my top drawer is filled with hackathon t-shirts. Last weekend I went to a hackathon, spent all night making something, and didn't land an honorable mention. That's okay because as I mentioned, losing is part of my life and I love the hunt more than the prize. The particulars of this specific hackathon aren't quite important, and although I'm going to talk negatively about it, I love and respect the labors of love with which volunteers and participants contributed. What was upsetting to me about this hackathon wasn't that I didn't win. It wasn't that other people made better things, because they did. It wasn't that there wasn't enough beer or swag. 

What upset me the most was that the judges decided that since there were so many "great submissions", they'd make a category on the spot called "Most Inspirational" in which a team of teenage girls who made a Wix website and some PDF resources for teachers' curriculums won a prize. If you're unfamiliar with what Wix is, it's an online tool for creating websites from templates with no coding required. Those judges looked a group of young women in the face and lied to them because of a political agenda. Is it inspirational that a bunch of girls made static PDF curriculums at a hackathon? Maybe it is. Maybe I'm just a bitch. Maybe I'd feel mean and guilty if they happened to read this post. Maybe I just need to get a life. 

Let me reiterate, they did not write one line of code. There were men and women at this hackathon who built robots, who made incredible 3d models and games. People who actually hacked at a hackathon and did not get mentioned. Instead a team of judges, some of which had degrees from MIT, decided to pretend that PDF curriculums were hacking.

Later at a friend's apartment, I was discussing the hackathon with other engineers present. Some people brought up good points. The girls had mentioned in their speech that it was their first hackathon. That they were new to "hacking" and we should be lenient. Their winning meant more to them in the long run than my losing. I joked that I was inspirational, right? I was a female who went to the bootcamp of LMGTFY. To paraphrase a collegue, I'm no longer "inspirational". Now I'm part of the established order of brogrammers. _Pass the mountain dew, brah. Git push -f, brah._

We were all new once. Tech changes so quickly, that every few years we're all new again. Will these women keep going to hackathons because of this win? Probably. Will they ever become programmers? I doubt it. I say that because a real hacker is someone who tries to code all night, and regardless of how shitty it looks, stands up there and says proudly, "Yeah, I made this. It didn't work out very well. But I learned a lot." This type of agenda is not only discouraging to others who genuinely love to build, it's dangerous to young women who could actually become programmers.

Don't lie to women. Tech is hard enough as it is.
