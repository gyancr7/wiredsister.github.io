Why do people think you don't need product managers?

I've worked at a few early stage startups now and one thing I've noticed is that they all have the same pattern: one really strong part of the organization early on. The catch here is that it's only *one* part of the company that is strong. Usually it ends up being my biggest beef at the startup. "How dare X team always push everyone else around, as if they're more important." In reality it's probably because they *are* more important. If the company was dumping money into a team that wasn't a powerhouse, they probably would have already gone out of business from financial mismanagement.

I'm an engineer. Engineers always think they're right. I often catch myself solving problems we don't have or coupling real world business value with how building it is going to *make me feel*.

"Yeah, you know what this feature needs? That new, shiny thing I saw at that flashy, overpriced conference."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My second startup job had an incredible sales culture where the CEO and sales leads had a rolodex full of customers from previous networks. Every time they closed they rang a bell in the office and gave a brief synopsis of the deals importance and relevance to revenue goals. There was also a follow-up email detailing how hard they worked to close said deal and the various humans responsible for wrangling stakeholders to sign. In retrospect, the engineers didn't even remember to send release updates most of the time. A blog was discussed, but really, who could be bothered to find the time? Marketing was a two person team that still managed to send emails and progress updates (it would have been an acute irony if the marketing team couldn't market themselves). Our product team in my first year consisted of a designer, two product/project managers, and myself (a then junior ux-designer). My first assignment was building the mobile website. They said, "I could do some designing if I wanted to." I eventually joined the engineering team to nobody's surprise.

All the companies I've worked for have had thriving cultures with intense and transparent executives who invest in personal development within the org. That being said, I have just one takeaway from those experiences:

Trust me, you need product managers.
-------------------------------------

You may succeed for quite some time without this. Hell, you may just have what it takes to do without. But trust me, eventually you will sit back and say "Why are things so bad?" and the answer will indubitably be because you have no product culture at your startup.

1. Hire PMs early and hire them slowly.
2. You are not your user. No, really.
3. Who doesn't want a well oiled machine that delivers value?
4. Set yourself up to pivot well, because you'll need to pivot.
5. If you're not measuring things then you're blind.

Product takes time to build. This is the part of your org that you can't hack together on a weekend and can't be discovered through "the next big deal". Product is a strategy, market-fit, and identity. Product is the glue that holds together the rest of your company. You aren't your user, as much as you think you are, and if this idea was easy someone else would have 100% marketshare. Engineers are expensive. Their salaries and development costs will potentially make up your biggest financial burden and blockers to beating the competitor. A strong product team ensures engineers are working at their top capacity and that there is coherence from quarter to quarter. You want only the best product people possible because today's tools live and die by the consumer. Your success hinges upon whether or not your stuff is usable and fits customer needs.

Lastly, if you're not measuring things, how do you know everything is okay? Sure, you've closed some deals and people are interested in what you're saying; but how do you know you'll have space to grow into? What if there is some vertical that would be ripe for your product, but you just didn't see it? How can you avoid the market getting away from you? If you have trouble answering those questions quickly, you'll have an even harder time pivoting when you should have or doubling-down in a product area for quadruple the payoff. And it gets even more complicated the more practical the business question. What if your sales guy comes to you with 100k deal on the table if we can build X feature? How can you decide to build it or not? It seems simple enough, but maybe in reality you'd have to hire more engineers and maintain that legacy feature for 5 years. Maybe that feature would only apply to a certain segment of users and alienate others. Maybe there is other side work that goes along with that feature to make it smoothly integrated into your platform. Whatever the cause, one thing is certain:

Product is paramount.
-----------------------

But you still don't believe me, do you? You're still thinking, listen Gina my company is a technical-snowflake-rainbow-cupcake where only great design decisions are made. Well, I'm so very glad but that still isn't enough. I had the pleasure of hearing [Kevin Ryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_P._Ryan) the founder of Gilt Groupe, Zola Registry, Business Insider, DoubleClick, and MongoDB speak the other day to a small room of people at [SecurityScorecard](http://securityscorecard.com/). One of my favorite stories he told about the many startups he's built was when [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB_Inc.) had to pivot from a PaaS with open source components (it realized that there were no existing database platform that met its "principles" for cloud architecture) to just focusing on building such a thing-- the document-oriented database system MongoDB. While I absolutely agree that this path was driven by engineering, it took serious understanding of product to double-down on the database they had been working on. Nowadays, it looks like Mongo is taking on the enterprise and Oracle. Regardless of how successful they will inevitably be, the lesson is clear. 

Admittedly, I don't know everything (shocking, I know). I'm not sure if there is a "golden ratio" of product managers to engineers, or if it's simply the amount of time per week spent agonizing over specs and design meetings. What I do know is often PMs are thought of as a nice to have, not a must have for early stage startups and the bottom line is it doesn't work.
